# Overview
This project is intended as a reimplementation of "Stochastic Local Search for Satisfiability Modulo Theories" in Racket. But now it serves as an incomplete QF_(BV)FP solver.

# Dependency
Just Racket (what else should you need?)

Maybe Z3, too. Z3 needs to be installed if the options `--try-real-models` and `--elim-eqs` are enabled. 

# How To
See `racket main.rkt -h`
